# Python-DataStructures-Algorithms-Implementation

Implementation of various data structures and algorithms in Python.
This project includes notions of pointers (C++ vs Python).

Main data structures implemented are:
- Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees)
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

## Main algorithms implemented are:
- Recursion 
### Sorts
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
### Tree Traversal
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search (preorder, postorder, inorder)
